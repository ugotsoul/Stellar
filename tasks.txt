//how do I do basic game physics (position, velocity)?

//how do I restrict player movement to within the game board?

//how do I move the player incrimently slower than the enemy?

//how do I check if an object exists in the game space?
//does the above matter, if I have an enemy interaction, where an enemy can another enemy, dependent on their size?

//collision behavior: if I hit the enemy, the should be some sort of bounce back factor - I move back, the enemy moves back.

//enemy pos - how can I restrict enemy to within game board bounds? (bouncing an enemy in the board?)


//how do I locate enemies?
//itterate through game array
//check enemy1 x, enemy2 x
//if collision

		//logic: if element/enemy colided with an enemy.
			//if enemy1.mass > enemy2.mass
			//hurt enemy2
			//add mass to enemy 1
			//if enemy2.mass < enemy1.mass
			//hurt enemy1
			//add mass to enemy 2
			//if enemy1.mass == enemy2.mass
			//randomly hurt one of the objects
