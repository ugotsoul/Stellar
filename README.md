# Stellar - an HTML5 & JavaScript Game

Stellar is an arcade style game about becoming the biggest, baddest, stellar object in the universe. In this universe, there is one law: eat, or be eaten! Stellar is my adaption of an amazing physics based game called [Osmos](http://www.osmos-game.com/). Stellar currently has 3 levels of gameplay, with a strategic element of matter loss/matter aquisition.
